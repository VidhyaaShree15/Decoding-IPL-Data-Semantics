# IPL Data Semantics Project

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data semantics project on IPL (Indian Premier League) data. The project involves creating and merging ontologies using datasets, defining classes and properties, and performing data extraction using SPARQL queries.

## Skills Used
- Ontology Creation
- Data Merging
- RDF/OWL Modeling
- SPARQL Queries

## Libraries Used
- rdflib
- pandas
- ast

## Contents
1. **Ontology Creation:**
   - Created classes like Match, City, People, Results, Stadium_venue, and Teams.
   - Defined object and data properties for semantic relationships.

2. **Merging Ontologies:**
   - Combined datasets into a single ontology.
   - Created and mapped object and data properties across merged datasets.

3. **Data Extraction:**
   - Used SPARQL queries to extract meaningful information from the ontology.
   - Implemented queries to find team names, venue names, and winning teams.

4. **SPARQL Queries:**
   - Executed SPARQL queries on both individual and merged ontologies for data retrieval.

## Usage
Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed. Run the provided Jupyter notebooks to execute the ontology creation, merging, and data extraction processes.
